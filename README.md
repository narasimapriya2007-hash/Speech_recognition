# Speech_recognition
This Python-based real-time speech recognition application listens continuously to microphone input, converts spoken words into text using Google Speech Recognition, and writes the output into a formatted text file. It supports note-taking, transcription, and voice-based text logging, with a voice command to stop execution.
